            <h1>STANDARDS</h1>
            <h2>OUR MARINE CORPS STANDARDS ARE NOT MERELY GUIDELINES TO FOLLOW, BUT A CODE THAT EACH AND EVERY MARINE LIVES.</h2>
            <p3>They are found in the way Marines fight on battlefields and the way we conduct ourselves in peacetime. They guide us to look out for those on our left and right, while in combat or while serving in our communities. They reinforce our resolve and shape our mindsetâ€”and they are an asset our entire Nation can count on. It is these unwavering standards that mark all that we stand for, and all that we stand against.

            <h1>PURPOSE</h1>
            <h2>A COLLECTIVE PURPOSE. AN EFFECTIVE MISSION.            </h2>
            <p3>The Marine Corps mission reflects every Marine's purpose. In essence, our Nation is that purpose. In our world, in ourselves, and in our way, there are conflicts, challenges, and obstacles that must be fought confidently and defeated convincingly for our Nation to prevail. These looming battles come in many forms and occur on many fronts, but each comes down to a critical choice: to demand victory or accept defeat. To pull together or fall apart. To give in or cave in. It is a decision each Marine conveys to our Nation with each battle won.
